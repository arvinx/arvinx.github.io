	        <h4><b>Amazon</b>
	            <small> - May 2014 - Current, Seattle</small>
	        </h4>
	        <p>I'm currently working in Amazon Web Services working on the S3 product. Within S3 (Simple Storage Service),
	            I'm on the indexing team that works on mapping bucket and filenames to 'inodes' in volumes storage.</p>

	        <div style="text-align:center">
	            <h5><a id="read-more">read more about my work here</a><h5>
	        </div>
	        <div id="amazon-extra" style="display:none">
	            <p>The project I'm working on runs on a large distributed computing
	                system that hooks onto a data chain and reads nodes that get sorted and packed in containers that are
	                stored on volumes and have their references stored in Amazon's DynamoDB. My contribution to the project
	                is to get the component to write these references to DynamoDB by removing it's old implementation and
	                updating other components on the distributed system to use my new interfaces in order to continue
	                functioning. I'm also writing a garbage collector service that will remove stale references from
	                DynamoDB and make sure what the references point to in volumes are also deleted.</p>

	            <p>I code in Java for my project and work with asyncronous framework developed by and for my team. Git
	                version control is used along with continuous deployment best practices. All commits are must be
	                approved by someone on the team through an internal Amazon code reivew board. Following that a push can
	                be made that checks if your package can be built with it's dependencies, then if your package can be
	                built with packages that depend on it. Once that is complete, all units tests are run for your package
	                and followed by all intergration tests for your team. This pipeline can continue across different test
	                staging servers before it hits specific regions in production. This workflow is a great way to insure
	                that no one can break the mainline and no one can check out code that doesn't work.</p>

	            <p>A great best practice I've been adopting from my team here is Test Driven Development (TDD). We first
	                make interfaces and have them reviewed by someone on the team and begin coding unit tests with mocks
	                (example using Mockito or dummy implementations). Then once the unit tests pass on the mock objects, we
	                can begin coding our implementations and updating our tests as we go along.</p>

	            <p>My fav part about developing at Amazon is that all our dependencies are managed using a service Amazon
	                has developed. It's command line interface makes it convienent to build your project using all the
	                direct child dependencies you have set in a configuration file and all the dependecies those dependecies
	                have and so forth down the massive massive tree you don't have to worry about. It's also easy to resolve
	                these dependencies in the configuration file. It offers support to also locallly build your project
	                completly and submit build requests with previous versions. And a lot more which I can't talk about!</p>

	            <p>My fav part about overall working at Amazon Web Services in S3 is the massie impact we have. I don't
	                think I'll ever be in a team that works at this scale hadling millions of requests a second that go
	                through the system! S3 is also still growing and trying to scale effeciently since Amazon is frugal.
	                This presents very interesting challanges that can't be solved easily and require a collaboration of
	                some of the brightests.</p>

	        <h4><b>Xtreme Labs</b>
	            <small> - May 2013 - August 2013, Toronto</small>
	        </h4>

	        <p>Xtreme Labs is a mobile app development company and here I worked on iOS apps. The first app I worked on for
	            the first month was an internal app store for iOS apps the company was developing and allowed users to
	            download and install the apps by build version and see PMs and lead devs working on the app. As well
	            supported users (company employees) giving reviews and thumbs up and down. I worked on the front end and the
	            backend api endpoints were handled by a senior developer.</p>

	        <p>The second project I was on for the last 3 months of my internship was a retail iOS 6 shopping app where I
	            worked on a larger team and pair programmed. I worked both on UI aspects of the app and on backend handling
	            data caching on persistant storage via AFNetworking and CoreData.</p>

	        <p>Our team followed weekly sprints and iteratively developed our app with multiple daily commits and having a
	            working build each week to demo. Working with git allowed us to move fast with flexibility because everyone
	            was making multiple commits daily on our project, so branching and rebasing made development much easier and
	            fun.</p>

	        <h4><b>Pokemon Contacts App</b>
	            <small> - September 2013</small>
	        </h4>
	        <p>After a summer at Xtreme Labs, I felt app development widthdrawl. I really wanted to work on something cool
	            and
	            create something I would want to use. Contact photos on my phone were always the default, never really liked
	            the idea of
	            taking pictures of my friends for this purpose or syncing them with facebook profile pictures. I used to
	            select Pokémon images
	            I would find online for a few of my contacts manually, and after the summer ended I figured I could automate
	            this task and make
	            it nice and easy as well throw in some randomization feature along with having images of every Pokémon!</p>

	        <p>I developed using some best practices I could think of such as recycling views and trying to cache objects in
	            memory temporarily for
	            faster run time. I also tried continuous refactoring of the project to break down larger classes that had
	            common reused code. I also
	            realized that backing up images would be a great idea as well, for a first time user who might not want to
	            lose all their
	            on contact images, and later allowing them to restore the images back. So overall it was a good experience
	            creating this app trying to craft a product people would use and optimizing the performance.</p>

	        <h4><b>Seakorp</b>
	            <small> - June 2012</small>
	        </h4>
	        <p>This is a timetable generator designed for University of Toronto undergraduate students (excluding
	            engineering) made by 3 friends and myself. The website has a database of all the courses offered during the
	            year and all the details such as location, course code, session, professor, and more importantly the times
	            and days it was offered. The user would select a basket of courses for a session such as fall and the
	            generator would generate all timetables possible. The generator will also rank the timetables produced
	            through settings chosen by the user such as picking days off and windows of time preferred to have
	            class. </p>

	        <p>The backend code was all done in Python since it was the most comfortable language for all 4 of us (used it
	            all during first year) and it allowed us to rapidly develop. I worked on the backend a little by consulting
	            how to generate timetables faster through different data structures and OOP design. I worked on organizing
	            the data mined through crawling the UofT website for course information by making scripts in python to
	            "clean" csv files and as well setting up the database and uploading everything from a .db file using MySQLdb
	            library from Oracle. Also I did the design of the website.
	            <br><br>The website has received over 10 000 unique visitors (representing approximately 2/5 of the
	            undergraduate population) and over 120 000 page views during course enrollment! (Data from Google Analytics)
	            <br><br>Note: currently 2 members have left and the ownership of the website has been transferred to the
	            other remaining member who has extended the website’s service (seakorp dot com) and is not the original
	            website the 4 of us have worked on.

            <p>Original source code from my first CS course, introduction to programming. I had decided to
            	try out Google's App Engine and see if I could hook up my program on there and play around with a little web design and front end AJAX. The database I used was small and it won't work for every actor. More information on this project is available from my app's page.

	        <p>Aside from programming, I enjoy learning the dismal science (economics). My curiosity
	        has turned into a pursuit of interest and has lead me to taking a few economics courses
	        and likely an economics minor. Economic issues like the financial crisis and government regulation
	        make me think of the impacts on everyone in the short and long run from investing to employment.
	        However I find micro to be more useful in a business aspect and so I took a full year course on advanced micro!
			<br> <br>
	        I also like improving the aesthetics of a website's design.<br>
	        It's very much an art having to meet user needs and present everything in a flowing and simple layout.
